# Line detection
## Why do I need this ?  
I need to develop an algorithm for a drone line tracking school project.  
The goal of this part of the project is to detect the nearest and biggest line of a photo.  

## How will it be implemented ?
OpenCV is used to detect rectangle shapes of a photo.  
Some shape filtering are processed with Numpy.  
Matplotlib is used to analysis the results.
